            <p>GST return filing is a mandatory compliance process for businesses registered under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, introduced in 2017. This process involves reporting business transaction details and tax information, thereby helping to standardize the GST framework and ensure proper tax collection and credit allocation.</p><br>
       <br>
        <p>The filing process includes submitting data on sales, purchases, output GST (tax collected on sales), and input tax credit (ITC) from purchases. Businesses are typically required to file GST returns monthly, quarterly, or annually, depending on their turnover and specific GST filing category. Each GST return summarizes details from invoices, receipts, payments, and other relevant financial transactions. To avoid penalties and maintain compliance, it is crucial for taxpayers to file their GST returns by the specified due dates.</p>

            <h1>Better GST Compliance Rating</h1> 
         <p>The GST compliance rating is given to the registered business by the government<br> after analysing various factors, including timely submission of annual and monthly<br> returns. This provides information about input credits used, paying taxes, and so <br>forth. Vendors with higher compliance ratings are deemed to be trustworthy by<br> their buyers. This allows them to choose the vendors that have the best track<br> record of paying their dues on time.</p> <br>
         <br>
         <p>Buyers can choose a more compliant vendor straight away to avoid having to deal<br> with the fallout from vendor carelessness later on thanks to the GST-compliance<br> rating, which will allow them to discover which vendors have the best track record<br> of paying their dues on time. An increased vendor compliance score increases the<br> buyer's eligibility for an input tax credit.</p>
