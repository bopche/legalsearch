            <p>GST return filing is a mandatory compliance process for businesses registered under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, introduced in 2017. This process involves reporting business transaction details and tax information, thereby helping to standardize the GST framework and ensure proper tax collection and credit allocation.</p><br>
       <br>
        <p>The filing process includes submitting data on sales, purchases, output GST (tax collected on sales), and input tax credit (ITC) from purchases. Businesses are typically required to file GST returns monthly, quarterly, or annually, depending on their turnover and specific GST filing category. Each GST return summarizes details from invoices, receipts, payments, and other relevant financial transactions. To avoid penalties and maintain compliance, it is crucial for taxpayers to file their GST returns by the specified due dates.</p>
