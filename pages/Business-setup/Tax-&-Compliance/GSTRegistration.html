        <h1 class="heading">What is GST Registration?</h1>
        <div class="inner">
     
            <p>GST registration is the process of obtaining a unique identification number for a business liable to pay Goods and Services Tax (GST). As per the Central Goods and Service Tax Act of 2017, businesses with an annual turnover of more than ₹40 lakh (or ₹20 lakh for some special category states) must register as normal taxable entities. In India, a GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number), commonly known as a GST number, consists of 15 digits. These digits are unique to each taxpayer and serve as their identification under the GST regime. This identification number helps to share all the operations and data related to the transactions with authorities.</p>
            <br>
              <p> GST or Goods and Service Tax is a destination-based, multi-stage, indirect tax system. It substitutes for VAT and other collective taxes. GST registration refers to the process of registering a firm under the GST Act of 2017. Under the GST regime, any business required to pay service tax, excise duty, VAT, or central excise must register for Goods and Service Tax (GST). GST registration is mandatory for all eCommerce sellers. Citizens can apply for a new GST online without needing to visit a government office. The registration process can be initiated on the GST portal. Upon submission of the GST application, the portal will immediately generate an ARN status.</p>

        <h2>GST ACT</h2>
        <p>The Central Goods and Services Tax Act of 2017, implemented to streamline taxation and curb tax evasion, establishes the framework for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) levied on intra-state and inter-state supplies of goods and services in India.</p>

        <h1>Benefits of Registering for GST</h1>
        <p>Registration under GST is an important step towards a unified tax system in India. It offers many advantages to registered businesses. A taxpayer<br> who registers under the GST Act of 2017 will receive the following benefits:</p>
        </div>

        <img src="https://assets.vakilsearch.com/legal_recognition.svg" class="img1"/>
        <h2>Legal Recognition</h2>
        <p>A firm can obtain legal recognition as a supplier of goods or services by registering for GST. This validates the company's legal status as an official entity.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="card1">
        <img src="https://assets.vakilsearch.com/Itc.svg" class="img1"/>
        <h2>Input Tax Credit (ITC)</h2>
        <p>Businesses that are registered can deduct the GST they pay on purchases from the GST they collect on sales by claiming the Input Tax Credit. Consequently, the entire tax liability is decreased.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="card1">
        <img src="https://assets.vakilsearch.com/wider_market_reach.svg" class="img1"/>
        <h2>Simplified Process</h2>
        <p>The GST system has reduced the complexity and time needed for compliance by streamlining the process for submitting taxes and making payments. With the help of a single online platform, businesses can more effectively manage their tax obligations.</p>

        <h2>Composition Scheme</h2>
        <p>Composition Scheme Under GST for Small Businesses allows them to pay tax at a lower, fixed rate. This reduces their tax burden and compliance requirements, making it easier to manage their finances.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="card1">
        <img src="https://assets.vakilsearch.com/handshakeblue.svg" class="img1"/>
        <h2>Higher Threshold for GST Registration</h2>
        <p>With a higher registration threshold, only businesses with an annual turnover above ₹40 lakh are required to register for GST. This excludes many small businesses from mandatory registration, easing their operational processes.</p>

     <div class="card1">
        <img src="https://assets.vakilsearch.com/e-commerce_platform.svg" class="img1"/>
        <h2>Eliminates the Cascading Effect of Taxes</h2>
        <p>GST eliminates the cascading effect of taxes by allowing input tax credit across the supply chain. This means that businesses can claim credit for the taxes paid on purchases, reducing the overall tax burden on end consumers.</p>

       <p>The GST compliance rating is a score given by the government to a business based on parameters such as timely filing of monthly and annual returns, furnishing details of input credits used, and taxes paid. This compliance rating shows customers and other firms how compliant they are with the tax department. Businesses with high compliance ratings are bound to receive Input Tax Credit (ITC) and refunds in a timely manner. The GST authorities prioritise processing ITC claims and refund requests from high-rated businesses, ensuring swift disbursement of credits and funds.</p>

<h1>GST Registration Eligibility and Threshold Limits</h1>
<p>Eligibility to Register for GST​​ Registration must be verified before registration. Individuals registered under the Pre-GST law should also opt<br> for GST registration. It is mandatory for businesses that have a turnover of ₹40 lakhs for the sale of goods in normal category states and ₹20<br> lakhs for the sale of goods in special category states. A company must register as a regular taxable entity under GST law if its annual<br> threshold limit exceeds ₹40 lakhs. The GST council recommends GST rates, tax exemptions, and other tax-related policies. Here is a<br> complete outline for the same.</p>

            <h1>Turnover Limits for GST Registration</h1>
            <p>Businesses exceeding an annual turnover of ₹40 lakhs (for goods) and ₹20 lakhs (for services) should register for GST and fulfil tax obligations<br> on their taxable goods and services. Although it is not mandatory, businesses with annual revenue under ₹40 lakhs in the respective financial<br> year are free to register for GST. Doing so entitles them to benefits from input tax credit.

    <h1>GSTIN and It’s Significance</h1>
    <p>
        A GSTIN number is a 15-digit code that identifies a registered taxpayer (mainly dealers, suppliers, or any business entity across India) registered under the GST regime. GSTIN is an abbreviation for Goods and Services Tax Identification Number. This provides greater transparency in the GST system, helps in collecting all the GST-related data from the vendors, and prevents tax evasion. Having a GST number provides many advantages for small enterprises. It gives businesses access to different government assistance and relief programs, allows them to claim input tax credit on their purchases, and increases their credibility with suppliers and consumers.</p>
<p>The GSTIN plays a crucial role in activities such as availing loans, claiming refunds, simplifying verification processes, making corrections, and understanding one's GST identification number.
